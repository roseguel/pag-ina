    <p>I thought love was only true in fairy tales
        Meant for someone else, but not for me
        Love was out to get me
        That's the way it seemed
        Disappointment haunted all my dreams
        Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
        Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
        I'm in love, I'm a believer
        I couldn't leave her if I tried
        I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
        The more I gave, the less I got, oh yeah
        What's the use in tryin'
        All you get is pain
        When I wanted sunshine, I got rain
        And then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
        Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
        I'm in love, I'm a believer
        I couldn't leave her if I tried
        What's the use of trying
        All you get is pain
        When I wanted sunshine, I got rain
        And then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
        Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
        I'm in love, I'm a believer
        I couldn't leave her if I tried
        Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer
        Not a trace, of doubt in my mind
        Now I'm a believer, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
        Now I'm a believer
        Then I saw her face
        Now I'm a believer
        Not a trace, of doubt in my mind</p>
